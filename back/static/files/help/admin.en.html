<h2>Help for administrators</h2>

Administrators can change the category of av registered user: 
by default a user registering  is student, but
by manual email request to the adminstristator of the  instance, 
a user can ask to be given instructor privilege (role), and hence be able
to create exercises, sequences of exercises, and manage exercise sessions.

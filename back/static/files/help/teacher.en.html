<h2>Help for instructors</h2>

<h4>General principle of this exercising tool</h4>
<p>This tool allows to train students to shell on a Unix system. </p>

<p>For students to be able to train by following exercises, they need to register to an exercise <b>session</b>.</p>

<p>A <b>session</b> is defined by a <b>sequence</b> of exercices, with a starting and an ending date, 
    together with one or two more parameters indicating:
    <ul>
        <li>for each exercise, if a given score is needed to be reached to access the next exercise 
            (set it to 0 for a free acceess to the next exercise, whatever the score to the current exercise.</li>
        <li>if the session is <i>timed</i>, meaning that a new exercise is available every day.</li>
    </ul>
</p> 

<p>An exercise <b>sequence</b> is an ordered list of exercises 
    chosen among the <i>available</i> exercises on the platform.
    Each exercise sequence is associated with a <b>profile</b>
 (an objective with a description). 
    As for now, a profile is associated to a job 
    (the more common student's goal is to become job-ready) and to 
    a skill level for that job(<i>beginner</i>, ..., <i>expert</i>).
    </p>



<h4> Exercises</h4>

<p>To fully grasp the following, instructors are advised to register to an existing <i>session</i> and try doing an exercise. 
Knowing how students solve exercises will indeed clarify a lot in the exercise authoring process.</p>

<p>All exercices follow the same operating mode:
    <ol>
      <li>the student gets an (html formatted) statement containing instructions and questions) <b>together with</b> a <i>question</i> archive file to download</li>
      <li>the student downloads the archive and put on a unix system [<a href='#access_to_a_Unix_system'>1</a>]</li> 
      <li>the student extracts the archive content and works in the corresponding folder hierarchy following instruction guidelines</li>
      <li>the student creates an <i>answer</i> archive including the current content of the folder hierarchy that hopefully changed when following the exercise's instructions</li>
      <li>the student submits the answer archive by uploading it on the platform</li>
      <li> the platform analyzes the answer archive and indicates to the students good and bad things with respect to instructions that were given. 
        The student also gets an overall success <i>score</i> for this submitted answer (from 0 to 100%).</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>The student can submit other answers to the exercise as much as he/she want (in the period during which the exercise is available -- see session details above).
    Every submitted answer is stored by the system, together with obtained feedback and score. Both the student and the instructor proposing the session can access details of the trials.
</p>

<h4>Possible actions for an instructor</h4>

Your usage of the platform will usually go from 
<ol>
    <li>Creating exercises</li>
    <li>Creating a sequence of exercises</li>
    <li>Creating a session relying on a sequence</li>
</ol>

For the two first steps, you can re-use existing exercises and sequences (you have access to those authored by other instructors).

<p>As an instructor you can: 
    <ul>
        <li>create exercices, edit or delete exercises <i>you</i> authored</li>
        <li>create/edit/delete exercise sequences. </li> 
        <li>create sessions and edit/delete those <i>you</i> created.</li> 
        <li>see results of students registered to your sessions</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p style="color:#FF0000";>Warning: as an instructor, actions that you take on the platform can have important consequences for others.
    Please think twice before doing edits/deletes operations. For instance, other instructors might have decided to use an exercise you proposed
    in a session they planned. Exercise modifications will affect next students accessing the exercise. Currently exercise <i>sequences</i> are
    common to all instructors, so changing the order of the exerices will affect students of all sessions referring to this exercise sequence. 
    We encourage instructors to include their name in the sequence name or description, to let other instructors know they're using the sequence.
</p>
<p><i><small>In progress: we're currently working on a version where each instructor referring to an 
    exercise of another instructor gets a distinct clone of the exercise, not to be affected
    by changes made by other authors. A similar idea will avoid authors to temper with sequences
    used by other authors.</small></i>
</p>

<h4>Authoring a new exercise</h4>

<p>Each exercise is composed of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <i>template</i> statement in <code>HTML</code> format containing generic instructions for students</li>
    <li>A <i>template</i> question archive in <code>.tar.gz</code> format</li>
    <li>A <code>python</code> script to <b>generate</b> <i>individualized</i> 
        student statements and question archive from the templates [<a href='#python'>2</a>]</li>
    <li>A <code>python</code> script to <b>analyze</b> a student's answer archive [<a href='#python'>2</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>To create an exercise, an instructor must provide all these elements. Though this can be done in several steps
(an exercise <i>status</i> indicates whether the exercise is ready to be included in sessions).</p>

<p>Additionnally, the instructor can indicate skills associated to the exercise. Obtaining top scores
    to the exercise will allow students to earn the corresponding skill up to some level.
</p>

<p>The simplest student statement creation scripts can simply provide a mere copy of the 
    template archive and statement.
    But the power of such scripts lies in building different statements for different students, 
    to provoke and promote discussions between peers and to avoid complete plagiarim of answers.</p>

<p>It is recommended that all the content of the question archive be contained in a single folder 
    (possibily with many subfolders) to group the elements on which the students will work.</p>

   <p>Concerning questions contained in an exercise statement, it is possible to ask students
    to write their answers in a file [such as <a href='#answers.txt'>2</a>] 
    included in the question archive and to be completed by students. But, some questions just
    consist in changing the archive (reorganizing folders, creating file, 
    modifying permissions, ...).</p>
 
 
<p> When a student submits an answer archive to an exercise, the <code>python</code> analyzing script 
    is launched by the  platform and gets as input the <code>HTML</code> student statement 
    (possiblly specific of the student), the <i>question</i> archive he/she was given at start
    (that can also be specific) and the answer archive the student just uploaded.</p>

<p>A python library is available to isntructors to reduce the production of boiler plate code. 
    E.g., it provides current archive manipulation routines. The library is made available to both 
    generating and analyzing scripts.</p>

<p>Moreover, a <code>gitlab</code> repository regroups the material for existing exercises
   (template archive, template statement, python scripts, answer archive examples). 
   Instructors can access it by simple request.

                <p>[1] Where can students solve a exercise? 
            <ul>
                <li>on their computer or device from a terminal (Linux, Free-BSD, WSL2 on Windows)</li>
                <li>on a website from their browser: several sites provide free access to Unix (real or emulated) systems 
                    that allow files to be uploaded and downloaded (e.g., <a href="https://replit.com" target="_blank">replit.com</a>,
                    <a href="https://cocalc.com/" target="_blank">CoCalc</a>, ...). 
                    This is a little less comfortable but it allows them to work from the browser with nothing to change on their system
                    when on a Windows OS.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>[2] written in Python v2 (we plan to move to Python v3 depending on the demand)
